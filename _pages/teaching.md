## Teaching Experience

My teaching experience has been mostly in the field. The <a href = "https://www.opwall.com/location/guyana/">Operation Wallacea</a> project involved a strong teaching component, training research assistants not only in the data collection methods, but also in the scientific grounding behind the project's work. I strongly enjoy interacting with students in the field, and enjoy teaching field methods for studying birds and large mammals.

I also briefly led an R coding club at the University of Guyana in 2019, and taught a cohort of University of Guyana students and faculty introductory coding in R with the *tidyverse* package.
 
## Teaching Interests

I am quite interested in teaching fundamental ecological, statistical and conservation-related concepts. I am also interested in teaching fundamental social scientific concepts to students from unrelated fields (Biology, Ecology, and so forth), as well as the human-dimensions of human-wildlife interactions and conservation science. 

I am interested in teaching field data collection methods, both for studying bird and mammal populations, and for quantitative social science research. In addition, I would like to one day teach quantitative methods relevant for both ecology and the social sciences.
