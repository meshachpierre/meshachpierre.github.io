Thank you for visiting my corner of the internet. I am Meshach Pierre, a conservation scientist and practitioner from Guyana, South America. I study the human dimensions of wildlife conservation issues surrounding birds and mammals. My most recent research has focused on human-wildlife coexistence and conflict in the Rupununi savannas of southern Guyana, the country of my birth.

In addition to academic research and teaching, I am an avid photographer and have had images published in CNN's Roads and Kingdoms, The North Carolina Naturalist, and in local (Guyanese) photography exhibitions. I have also produced a few short documentary-styled videos and have published newspaper articles as well as my blog, Guianensis.
