Hi, new Meshach,

Meshach from the past here. I'm pushing this to a new repo then cloning a different theme here, with the goal of getting
a gallery going. This theme seems a lot more flexible and well-documented, in which case I will get everything going bit
-by-bit. If anything critically goes wrong, then refer back to this repo and this file for further information.

I was attempting to make a portfolio but kept running into having to fuse multiple themes/website plans entirely and it
was too complicated and wouldn't work. I'm now going to try switching themes entirely.
