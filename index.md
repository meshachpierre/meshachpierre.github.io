#### Welcome
<br>
Thank you for visiting my corner of the internet. I am Meshach Pierre, an MA student in Criminology, Law, and Society at the University of Florida. I study human-wildlife coexistence and conflict in the Rupununi savannas of southern Guyana, the country of my birth. 
<br>

In addition to academic research and teaching, I am an avid photographer and have had images published in CNN's Roads and Kingdoms, The North Carolina Naturalist, and in local (Guyanese) photography exhibitions. I have also produced a few short documentary-styled videos and have published a newspaper article as well as a blog.
