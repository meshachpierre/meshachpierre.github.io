### Research Interests

<img src="assets/images/research/wwf_bat3_lcondo.jpg" alt = "Me setting a camera trap (Photo: © Liz Condo)"/>

I am interested in the conservation of wildlife in the Guiana Shield, Caribbean, and Latin America. Broadly, I have the following research interests: bird and large mammal ecology and conservation; and the human dimensions of human-wildlife interactions, including and human-wildlife coexistence and conflict.

I am most interested in applied research that aims to benefit both wildlife and the people who live alongside them. This may range from understanding the effects of land use on wildlife populations, and/or the coexistence of Indigenous communities with wildlife.

As I journey further into the human-dimensions of conservation, I hope to apply mixed-methodological approaches. I also aim to conduct socio-ecological that combines social and ecological datasets to inform conservation decisions. 

### Current Research

##### Master's research (MA Criminology, Law, and Society)

**Committee chair/advisor**: <a href = "https://soccrim.clas.ufl.edu/jessica-kahler/">Dr. Jessica Kahler</a>
<br>**Co-advisor**: <a href = "https://www.rupununiwildlife.org/">Dr. Matthew Hallett</a>

My current research aims to understand the human-dimensions of human-jaguar coexistence and conflict in the Rupununi region of Guyana. I am applying the interdisciplinary conservation criminology framework to understand risk perceptions, environmental stewardship and guardianship intention towards jaguars and livestock. I am applying criminological and sociological theories and concepts in a new, novel setting: remote, rural, ranches and mostly-Indigenous communities.

This project is part of the Sustainable Wildlife Management Project-Guyana's wider Human-wildlife conflict project led by Dr. Matthew Hallett 

##### Other projects

###### Land-use effects on mammal and ground-bird populations

<img src="assets/images/research/landuse.jpg" alt = "A chainsaw sits at the base of a tree"/>

I am part of a collaborative project that aims to understand the impacts of extractive land use activities (logging, mining, and hunting) on populations of large and medium-bodied mammals and ground birds in Guyana. We are still in the early phases of this project. Please do get in touch if you would like to take part.

### Past research

##### Human-black caiman conflict in the North Rupununi wetlands (2017-2019)

<img src="assets/images/research/bc_conflict.jpg" alt = "Caiman house rangers watch a released black caiman"/>

This project (in collaboration with <a href = "https://rupununiwildlife.org/">Dr. Matthew Hallett</a> and <a href = "http://caimanhouse.com/">Caiman House</a>) was the first study of human-black caiman conflict in the Rupununi region of Guyana. We collected survey data on fishing behaviour, attitudes towards and interactions with black caiman (<i>Melanosuchus niger</i>), the largest aquatic predator in South America.

This project served as the final project for my Postgraduate Diploma in International Wildlife Conservation Practice at the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU), University of Oxford. I was supervised by <a href = "https://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-claudio-sillero#/">Prof. Claudio Sillero-Zubiri</a> and <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EVJ010MAAAAJ&hl=fil">Dr. Kim Jacobsen</a>.

We are currently in the process of publishing our results in a peer-reviewed journal. Once they are accepted, they will be disseminated broadly.

##### Jaguar populations in a mixed-land use landscape (2014-2015)

<img src="assets/images/research/cobb.jpg" alt = "Logging in the Siparuni"/>

This project formed part of my Panthera Winston Cobb Memorial Fellowship (2014-2015) research. We studied the large-medium bodied mammals of the Siparuni logging concession operated by Demerara Timbers Ltd. (DTL). This concession featured logging, hunting, and mining.

An internal report for this project is available upon request. We are also planning to publish the findings (along with the data and code) in a peer reviewed journal.

##### Biodiversity assessment of the Upper Berbice region, Guyana (2014)

<img src="assets/images/research/wwf_bat3_lcondo_2.jpg" alt = "Leroy Ignacio and I configuring a GPS unit"/>

This collaboration between Panthera-Guyana and WWF-Guianas was one of the first activities I undertook as Panthera-Guyana's Winston Cobb Memorial Fellow (2014-2015). We used camera traps and track surveys to document the large-medium mammals of a previously understudied (by Western scientists) forest in the Upper Berbice area. 

The results from this project were published as a chapter in the final report of WWF BAT 3, and in the journal Check List (see below).
